Don’t make light of this. You have come a long way in a short amount of time. You have developed the important and valuable set of skills in developing deep learning models for time series forecasting. You can now confidently:



- Use naive and classical methods like SARIMA and ETS to quickly develop robust baseline
  models for a range of different time series forecasting problems, the performance of which
  can be used to challenge whether more elaborate machine learning and deep learning
  models are adding value.􏰀 
- Transform native time series forecasting data into a form for fitting supervised learning algorithms and confidently tune the amount of lag observations and framing of the prediction problem. 
- Develop MLP, CNN, RNN, and hybrid deep learning models quickly for a range of different time series forecasting problems, and confidently evaluate and interpret their performance.
